days of receipt of an invoice from WSO2 and are non-refundable. WSO2 may suspend or cancel performance of
all or part of the Subscription or Services and may change its credit terms (after notifying You) if actual
payment is not received within 60 calendar days of Your receipt of WSO2's invoice. Payments past due 60
calendar days will incur interest at the rate of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permitted by law,
whichever is less. You will also pay all costs incurred by WSO2 to collect undisputed amounts due, including
legal fees, whether or not litigation is commenced.

16.10 Agreement to Governing Law and Dispute Resolution. Each party agrees to the applicable governing law above,
and to the exclusive method of dispute resolution. Where the applicable dispute resolution procedure is
arbitration, the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties, and judgment
may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in the above provision prevents either party
from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable or injunctive relief. Any dispute or other
action arising out of this Agreement must be brought within one year of the date the cause of action accrued
. An action for nonpayment may be brought within two years of the date of last payment.
16.11 Regional Agreement Variations: WSO2 Australia Pty Limited. Based upon the above, If You enter into this
Agreement with WSO2 Australia Pty Limited, Sections 9.2, and 13 are replaced with the following:
9.2   Taxes. All fees are exclusive of any applicable Taxes. You will pay to WSO2 an amount equal to any
taxes arising from or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation, GST, use or value
added taxes, which are paid by or are payable by WSO2. "Taxes" means any form of taxation, levy,
duty, customs fee, charge, contribution or impost of whatever nature and by whatever authority
imposed (including without limitation any fine, penalty, surcharge or interest), excluding, however,
any taxes based solely on the net income of WSO2. If You are required under any applicable law or
regulation, domestic or foreign, to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to WSO2, then
the sum payable to WSO2 will be increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had Subscriber made no withholdings or deductions.
Where a supply under this Agreement is a taxable supply, all amounts payable or other consideration
provided must be increased by the amount of GST payable in relation to the supply. All GST must be
paid at the time any payment for any supply to which it relates is payable (provided a valid tax
invoice has been issued for the supply). In this Section, "GST", "tax invoice" and "taxable supply"
have the meanings given to them in the A New Tax Systems (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth).
13.   Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY DAMAGES FOR BODILY INJURY (INCLUDING DEATH) WHICH SHALL
BE UNLIMITED, WSO2'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), IS LIMITED IN ANY CALENDAR
YEAR TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY SUBSCRIBER FOR SERVICES DURING THAT CALENDAR YEAR. IF YOU HAVE PAID NO
FEES, OR ARE A NON-COMMERCIAL, EDUCATIONAL, OR TRIAL LICENSEE, WSO2'S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO
YOU IS $100.
NO EVENT WILL WSO2 BE LIABLE FOR ANY "INDIRECT LOSSES" BEING: (A) DOWNTIME COSTS, LOST BUSINESS,
REVENUES, OR PROFITS, FAILURE TO REALIZE EXPECTED SAVINGS OR OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO DATA,
LOSS OF GOODWILL OR REPUTATION, COSTS OF SOFTWARE RESTORATION; AND (B) ANY LOSS THAT DOES NOT ARISE
NATURALLY OR ACCORDING TO THE USUAL COURSE OF THINGS FROM A BREACH, ACT OR OMISSION RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY OF THE FOREGOING ARE FORESEEABLE, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WSO2
HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING. THESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS
OF THE BASIS OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, MISREPRESENTATION, BREACH, DEFAMATION, INFRINGEMENT
OF PUBLICITY, PRIVACY, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR ANY OTHER CONTRACT OR TORT CLAIM.
16.12 Regional Agreement Variations: WSO2 Germany GmbH. Based upon the above, If You enter into this Agreement
with WSO2 Germany GmbH, Sections 6.5, 9.1, and 9.2 are replaced with the following:
6.5   Non-solicitation. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year after its
termination, neither party will directly (a) solicit for hire or engagement any of the other party's
personnel who were involved in the provision or receipt of Services under this Agreement or (b) hire
or engage any person or entity who is or was employed or engaged by the other party and who was
involved in the provision or receipt of Services under this Agreement until one hundred eighty (180)
calendar days following the termination of the person's or entity's employment or engagement with
the other party.
For purposes herein, "solicit" does not include broad-based recruiting efforts, including without
limitation help wanted advertising and posting of open positions on a party's internet site. If You
hire or engage directly or indirectly any personnel of WSO2 in violation of this section, You will pay
WSO2 a contractual penalty equal to three times the monthly billing rate (assuming 168 hours per
month) for such personnel.
9.1   Fees. After You sign an Order, or upon renewal of a Subscription, WSO2 will send you an invoice. You
will pay all fees specified in invoices. All payments are due within thirty (30) calendar days of
receipt of an invoice from WSO2 and are non-refundable. WSO2 may suspend or cancel performance of
all or part of the Subscription or Services and may change its credit terms (after notifying You) if
actual payment is not received within sixty (60) calendar days of Your receipt of WSO2's invoice.
Payments past due sixty (60) calendar days will incur interest at the rate of 9 percentage points
above the ECB basic interest rate per year. In addition, Subscriber has to pay 40 EUR in recovering

other party's personnel who were involved in the provision or receipt of Services under this Agreement

payable to WSO2 will be increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had Subscriber made no withholdings or deductions. In such cases You shall
also deposit with the tax authorities and within the time required under law, the withheld or deducted
amount and shall provide WSO2 with the relevant certificates in relation thereto.
16.1  Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
contrary to law, in whole or in part, this Agreement will be interpreted and construed as if such
provision had never been included herein. The remaining part of such provision and all other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. In such event, the parties
undertake to endeavor in good faith to replace the said provision by a valid, legal, and enforceable
provision which contains, as nearly as possible, the rights and obligations contained in the provision
to be replaced.
